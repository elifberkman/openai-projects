# OPENAI PROJECTS

This repository contains a collection of OpenAI projects to demonstrate the capabilities of OpenAI. Each project has its own folder containing the project files and a README.md file with instructions on how to run the project.

# Projects

### 1. Natural Language to SQL
The Natural Language to SQL project uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to convert natural language into a SQL query. The project folder contains Python scripts (db_utils.py, main.py, openai_utils.py) and a sample jupyter notebook file (NLP-to-SQL.ipynb). 

### 2. Automatic Exam Creator
The Automatic Exam Creator project uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to automatically create a quiz and solution guide for teachers. The project folder contains Python scripts (exam-simulator.py, main.py, teacher.py, test_creator.py) and a sample jupyter notebook file (auto-exam-creator.ipynb).

### 3. Automatic Recipe Creator
The Automatic Recipe Creator project uses OpenAI's DALLE model to generate recipes and food pictures automatically from an ingredient list. The project folder contains Python scripts (dalle.py, main.py, recipe.py) and a sample jupyter notebook file (auto-recipe-creator.ipynb).

### 4. Automatic Blog Post Generator
The Automatic Blog Post Generator project uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate blog posts and publish them on the internet. The project folder contains Python scripts (auto-blog-post.py, blog_utils.py, main.py, openai_utils.py) and a sample jupyter notebook file (auto-blog-post.ipynb).

### 5. Reddit Sentiment Analysis
The Reddit Sentiment Analysis project uses OpenAI's GPT-2 model to perform sentiment analysis on subreddit posts about public companies and stocks. The project folder contains a Python script and a sample input file. 

### 6. Automatic Code Documentation
The Automatic Code Documentation project uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to automatically generate Python docstrings. The project folder contains a Python script and a sample input file. 

### 7. Fine-tunning ChatBot
The Fine-tuning ChatBot project uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to create a StackOverflow chatbot. The project folder contains a Python script and a sample input file. 

### 8. Translation
The Translation project uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to automatically read foreign newspapers and then translate and summarize news in other countries. The project folder contains a Python script and a sample input file. 

### 9. Text Embedding
The Text Embedding project uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to perform text embedding on a custom data set for custom question answering. The project folder contains a Python script and a sample input file.
