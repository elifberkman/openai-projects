# OPENAI PROJECTS

This repository contains a collection of OpenAI projects to demonstrate the capabilities of OpenAI. Each project has its own folder containing the project files and a README.md file with instructions on how to run the project.

# Projects

### 1. Natural Language to SQL
The Natural Language to SQL project uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to convert natural language into a SQL query. The project folder contains a Python scripts (db_utils.py, main.py, openai_utils.py) and a sample jupyter notebook file (NLP-to-SQL.ipynb). 

### 2. Automatic Exam Creator
The Automatic Exam Creator project uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to automatically create a quiz and solution guide for teachers. The project folder contains a Python script and a sample input file. 

### 3. Automatic Recipe Creator
The Automatic Recipe Creator project uses OpenAI's DALLE model to generate recipes and food pictures automatically from an ingredient list. The project folder contains a Python script and a sample input file. 

### 4. Automatic Blog Post Generator
